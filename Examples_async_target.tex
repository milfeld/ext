\section{Asynchronous Execution of a \code{target} Region Using Tasks}
\label{sec:async_target}

The following example shows how the \code{task} and \code{target} constructs 
are used to execute multiple \code{target} regions asynchronously. The task that 
encounters the \code{task} construct generates an explicit task that contains 
a \code{target} region. The thread executing the explicit task encounters a task 
scheduling point while waiting for the execution of the \code{target} region 
to complete, allowing the thread to switch back to the execution of the encountering 
task or one of the previously generated explicit tasks.

The Fortran version has an interface block that contains the \code{declare} \code{target}. 
An identical statement exists in the function declaration (not shown here).

The following example shows how the \code{task} and \code{target} constructs 
are used to execute multiple \code{target} regions asynchronously. The task dependence 
ensures that the storage is allocated and initialized on the device before it is 
accessed.

The Fortran example below is similar to the C version above. Instead of pointers, though, it uses
the convenience of Fortran allocatable arrays on the device. An allocatable array has the
same behavior in a \code{map} clause as a C pointer, in this case.

If there is no shape specified for an allocatable array in a \code{map} clause, only the array descriptor
(also called a dope vector) is mapped. That is, device space is created for the descriptor, and it
is initially populated with host values. In this case, the \plc{v1} and \plc{v2} arrays will be in a
non-associated state on the device. When space for \plc{v1} and \plc{v2} is allocated on the device
the addresses to the space will be included in their descriptors.

At the end of the first \code{target} region, the descriptor (of an unshaped specification of an allocatable
array in a \code{map} clause) is returned with the raw device address of the allocated space.
The content of the array is not returned. In the example the data in arrays \plc{v1} and \plc{v2}
are not returned. In the second \code{target} directive, the \plc{v1} and \plc{v2} descriptors are
re-created on the device with the descriptive information; and references to the
vectors point to the correct local storage, of the space that was not freed in the first \code{target}
directive.  At the end of the second \code{target} region, the data in array \plc{p} is copied back
to the host since \plc{p} is not an allocatable array.

A \code{depend} clause is used in the \code{task} directive to provide a wait at the beginning of the second 
\code{target} region, to insure that there is no race condition with \plc{v1} and \plc{v2} in the two tasks.
It would be noncompliant to use \plc{v1} and/or \plc{v2} in lieu of \plc{N} in the \code{depend} clauses, 
because the use of non-allocated allocatable arrays as list items in the first \code{depend} clause would 
lead to unspecified behavior.
