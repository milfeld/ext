\section{The \code{firstprivate} Clause and the \code{sections} Construct}
\label{sec:fpriv_sections}

In the following example of the \code{sections} construct  the \code{firstprivate} 
clause is used to initialize the private copy of \code{section\_count} of each 
thread. The problem is that the \code{section} constructs modify \code{section\_count}, 
which breaks the independence of the \code{section} constructs. When different 
threads execute each section, both sections will print the value 1. When the same 
thread executes the two sections, one section will print the value 1 and the other 
will print the value 2. Since the order of execution of the two sections in this 
case is unspecified, it is unspecified which section prints which value.
