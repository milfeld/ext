\section{The \code{taskyield} Construct}
\label{sec:taskyield}

The following example illustrates the use of the \code{taskyield}  directive. 
The tasks in the example compute something useful and then do some computation 
that must be done in a critical region. By using \code{taskyield} when a task 
cannot get access to the \code{critical} region the implementation can suspend 
the current task and schedule some other task that can do something useful.
