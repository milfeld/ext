\section{\code{linear} Clause in Loop Constructs}
\label{sec:linear_in_loop}

The following example shows the use of the \code{linear} clause in a (parallel) loop construct to allow the proper parallelization of a loop that contains an induction variable (\plc{j}).  At the end of the execution of the parallel loop construct, the original variable \plc{j} is updated with the value, \plc{N/2} for this case, from the last iteration of the loop.
