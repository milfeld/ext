\chapter{SIMD}
\label{chap:simd}

This chapter includes examples that illustrate the use of SIMD constructs for vectorization.

Compilers may not vectorize loops when they are complex or possibly have 
dependencies, even though the programmer is certain the loop will execute 
correctly as a vectorized loop.  SIMD constructs assure the compiler 
that the loop can be vectorized.
