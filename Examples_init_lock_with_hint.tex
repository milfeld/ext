\subsection{The \code{omp\_init\_lock\_with\_hint} Routine}
\label{subsec:init_lock_with_hint}

The following example demonstrates how to initialize an array of locks in a \code{parallel} region by using \code{omp\_init\_lock\_with\_hint}.
The hints are combined with the \code{|} (or) operator in C/C++ and the \code{+} (addition) operator in Fortran.
