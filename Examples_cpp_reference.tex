\section{C++ Reference in Data-Sharing Clauses}
\label{cpp_reference}

C++ reference types are allowed in data-sharing attribute clauses as of OpenMP 4.5, except
for the \code{threadprivate}, \code{copyin} and \code{copyprivate} clauses.  
(See the \textbf{Data-Sharing Attribute Clauses} Section of the 4.5 OpenMP specification.)
When a variable with C++ reference type is privatized, the object the reference refers to is privatized in addition to the reference itself.
The following example shows the use of reference types in data-sharing clauses in the usual way.
Additionally it shows how is data sharing of formal arguments with C++ reference type on orphaned task generating constructs determined implicitly. (See the \textbf{Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Construct} Section of the 4.5 OpenMP specification.)
