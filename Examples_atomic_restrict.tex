\section{Restrictions on the \code{atomic} Construct}
\label{sec:atomic_restrict}

The following non-conforming examples illustrate the restrictions on the \code{atomic} 
construct. 

\cexample{atomic_restrict}{1}

\fexample{atomic_restrict}{1}

\cexample{atomic_restrict}{2}

\fortranspecificstart
The following example is non-conforming because \code{I} and \code{R} reference 
the same location but have different types.

\fnexample{atomic_restrict}{2}

Although the following example might work on some implementations, this is also 
non-conforming:

\fnexample{atomic_restrict}{3}
