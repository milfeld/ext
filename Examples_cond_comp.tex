\label{sec:cond_comp}

\ccppspecificstart
The following example illustrates the use of conditional compilation using the 
OpenMP macro \code{\_OPENMP}. With OpenMP compilation, the \code{\_OPENMP} 
macro becomes defined.

\cnexample{cond_comp}{1c}

\fortranspecificstart
The following example illustrates the use of the conditional compilation sentinel. 
With OpenMP compilation, the conditional compilation sentinel \code{!\$} is recognized 
and treated as two spaces. In fixed form source, statements guarded by the sentinel 
must start after column 6.
