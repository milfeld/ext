The following are examples of the OpenMP API directives, constructs, and routines.
\ccppspecificstart
A statement following a directive is compound only when necessary, and a 
non-compound statement is indented with respect to a directive preceding it.

Each example is labeled as \plc{ename.seqno.ext}, where \plc{ename} is 
the example name, \plc{seqno} is the sequence number in a section, and 
\plc{ext} is the source file extension to indicate the code type and 
source form.  \plc{ext} is one of the following:
\begin{compactitem}
\item \plc{c} -- C code,
\item \plc{cpp} -- C++ code,
\item \plc{f} -- Fortran code in fixed form, and
\item \plc{f90} -- Fortran code in free form.
\end{compactitem}
