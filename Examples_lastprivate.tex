\section{The \code{lastprivate} Clause}
\label{sec:lastprivate}

Correct execution sometimes depends on the value that the last iteration of a loop 
assigns to a variable. Such programs must list all such variables in a \code{lastprivate} 
clause  so that the values of the variables are the same as when the loop is executed 
sequentially.
